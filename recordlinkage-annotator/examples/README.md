## Prisoners book

This data is this example, [`examples/offences_dishonesty.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J535D165/recordlinkage-annotator/master/examples/annotation_dishonesty.json), is loosely based on [*Prisoners book 1 : 1905-07*](https://doi.org/10.7925/drs1.ucdlib_43946). The aim is to identify convictions by the same individual. This can be seen as a deduplication task.
